## About

It's Virtual Apple Keyboard. You can use you real keyboard to print, or use this virtual keyboard.
I created this project to demonstrate my technologies.
This is an interesting tool that shows how you can implement an on-screen keyboard.

## Documentation

<ul>
  <li>Type on your keyboard and the text will be displayed on the screen, accompanied by a pleasant animation of the key response.</li>
  <li>You can type with your mouse by pressing the corresponding keys</li>
  <li>The keyboard has alternate keys just like your regular keyboard. You can use them both on your keyboard and on the virtual one. They work exactly the same as on a regular keyboard.</li>
  <li>Note that the 'BackSpace' key does not work on your keyboard. It can only be activated on the virtual keyboard</li>
</ul>
